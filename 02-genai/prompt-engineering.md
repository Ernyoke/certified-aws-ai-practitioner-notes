# Prompt Engineering

- Prompt Engineering: developing, designing and optimizing prompts to enhance the output of foundation models for our needs
- Improved prompting techniques consist of:
    - *Instructions*: a task for the model to do (description, how the model should perform)
    - *Context*: external information to guide the model
    - *Input data*: the input for which we want a response
    - *Output indicator*: the output type or format

## Negative Prompting

- A technique where we explicitly instruct the model on what not to include or do in its response
- Negative prompting helps to:
    - Avoid unwanted content: we explicitly state what not to include, reducing the chances of irrelevant or inappropriate content
    - Maintain focus: helps the model to stay on topic and not stray into areas that are not useful or desired
    - Enhanced clarity: prevents the use of complex terminology or details data, making the output clearer and more desirable
