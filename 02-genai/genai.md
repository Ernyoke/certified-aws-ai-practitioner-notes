# GenAI Introduction

## What is Generative AI?

- Generative AI (GenAI) is a subset of Deep Learning
- GenAI is used to generate new data similar to the data it was trained on
- A GenAI network can be trained with the following type of data:
    - Text
    - Images
    - Audio
    - Code
    - Video
    - etc.

## Foundation Model

- To generate data we must rely on a Foundation Model
- Foundation Models are trained on a wide variety of input data
- To train a Foundation Model may cost tens of millions of dollars
- Examples of models: GPT-4o is one of the foundation model behind ChatGPT
- There is a wide selection of Foundation Models from companies such as:
    - OpenAI
    - Meta (Facebook)
    - Amazon
    - Google
    - Anthropic
    - many more
- Some of these models are open source (example Llama from Meta, Google BERT) and other models are under commercial license (such as GPT-4o form OpenAI)

## Large Language Models

- Type of AI designed to generate coherent human-like text (example ChatGPT)
- They are trained on large corpus of text data
- They are usually very big models with billions of parameters and trained of books, articles, websites and other textual data
- They can perform language-related tasks such as:
    - Translation
    - Summarization
    - Question answering
    - Content creation
- Interacting with an LLM:
    - We usually interact with the LLM by giving it a prompt
    - The model will leverage all the existing content it has learned from to generate new content
- The output of an LLM is non-deterministic: the generated text may be different for every user that uses the same prompt

## GenAI for Images

- Similarly to LLMs we can have models which can generate image from text (and vice-versa)
- Example of these models are Diffusion Models (Stable Diffusion from Stability AI)
