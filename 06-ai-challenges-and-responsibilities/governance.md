# Governance for AI

## Importance of Governance and Compliance

- Governance is about managing, optimizing and scaling the organizational AI initiative
- Governance is instrumental in order to build trust
- Governance ensures responsible and trustworthy AI practices
- It also mitigates risks: bias, privacy violations, avoid unintended consequences
- We need to establish clear policies, guidelines and oversight mechanisms to ensure AI systems align with legal and regulatory requirements
- We need to protect ourselves from potential legal and reputational risks
- We need to foster public trust and confidence in the responsible deployment of AI

## Governance Framework

- Example approach:
    - We establish an AI Governance Board or Committe: this team should include representatives from various departments, such as legal, compliance, data privacy and subject matter experts (SMEs) in AI development
    - We define the roles and responsibilities: outline the roles and responsibilities of the governance board (example: oversight, policy-making, risk assessment, decision-making process)
    - Implement policies and procedures: we develop comprehensive policies and procedures that address the entire AI lifecycle from data management ot model deployment and monitoring

## AWS Tools for Governance

- Amazon Inspector
- AWS Audit Manager
- AWS Artifact
- AWS CloudTrail
- AWS Trusted Advisor

## Governance Strategies

- Policies: principles, guidelines and responsible AI considerations
    - Data management, model training, output validation, safety and human oversight
    - Intellectual property, bias mitigation and privacy protection
- Review Cadence: combination of technical, legal and responsible AI review
    - Clear timeline: monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.
    - Include subject matter experts, legal and compliance teams and end-users
- Review Strategies:
    - Technical review on model performance, data quality, algorithm robustness
    - Non-technical reviews on policies, responsible AI principles, regulatory requirements
    - Test and validate procedure for outputs before deploying a new mode
    - Clear decision-making framework to make decisions based on review results
- Transparency Standards:
    - Publish information about the AI models, training data, key decisions made
    - Document the limitations, capabilities and use case of AI solutions
    - Channels for end-users and stakeholders to provide feedback and raise concerns
- Team Training Requirements:
    - Train on relevant policies, guidelines and best practices
    - Training on bias mitigation and responsible AI practices
    - Encourage cross-functional collaboration and knowledge-sharing
    - Implement training and certification program

## Data Governance Strategies

- Responsible AI:
    - Responsible framework and guidelines (bias, fairness, transparency, accountability)
    - Monitor AI ang GenAI for potential bias, fairness issues and unintended consequences
    - Educate and train teams on responsible AI practices
- Governance Structure an Roles:
    - Establish data governance council or committee
    - Define clear roles and responsibilities for data stewards, data owners and data custodians
    - Provide training and support to AI and ML practitioners
- Data Sharing and Collaborations:
    - Data sharing agreements to share data securely within the company
    - Data virtualization or federation to give access to data without compromising ownership
    - Foster a culture of data-driven decision-making and collaborative governance

## Data Management Concepts

- Data Lifecycles: collection, processing, storage, consumption,archival
- Data Logging: tracking inputs, outputs, performance metrics, system events
- Data Residency: where data is processed and stored (regulations, privacy requirements, proximity of compute and data)
- Data Monitoring: data quality, identifying anomalies, data drifts
- Data Analysis: statistical analysis, data visualizations and explorations
- Data Retention: regulatory requirements, historical data for training, cost

## Data Lineage

- Source Citation:
    - Attributing and acknowledging the sources of the data
    - What are the datasets, databases and other sources we are using
    - What are relevant licenses, terms of use and other permissions
- Document Data Origin:
    - Details of the collection process
    - Methods used to clean and curate the data
    - Pre-processing and transformation to the data
- Data Cataloging: organization and documentation of datasets
- It is helpful to have data lineage fore data transparency, traceability and accountability
