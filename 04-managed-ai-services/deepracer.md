# AWS DeepRacer

- Fully autonomous 1/18th scale race car driven by reinforcement learning (RL)
- It is an educational tool for reinforcement learning
- We can use DeepRacer Console to train and evaluate deep RL models (backed by SageMaker) in a 3D simulated environment
- We can also deploy these RL models to a DeepRacer Vehicle (physical) for autonomous driving. Vehicle contains:
    - Internal compute module
    - Front camera
    - WiFi connection
- DeepRacer League: global autonomous racing league for virtual a physical events
